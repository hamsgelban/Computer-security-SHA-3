# Computer-security-SHA-3
SHA-3 (Secure Hash Algorithm 3) is a cryptographic function from NIST for data integrity and security. Built on Keccak's sponge construction, it offers strong collision resistance and efficiency, used in password hashing, file integrity checks, digital signatures, and data deduplication, making it ideal for modern, resilient security needs.
